description: Our story of how we replaced video games with cardboard and the joy of board gaming with the family.

> Ok, so I’m going to use my innate power to deal Iron Legacy 2 fire damage.  Then I’ll play Excavation to put 3 environment cards from the trash into the bottom of the environment deck.  Your turn dad.  

That’s the kind of talk you’ll likely hear if you hang out in our house lately.  Yes, I’m talking about board games.  Not the ones you’re used to hearing about though.  In case you hadn’t heard, there is quite the [board game renaissance](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rise-of-board-games) happening right now, and for good reason.  Let’s step back a moment though.

### The House of Video Game Consoles
We had accumulated the typical video game systems you might expect.  The Wii U was there to fake us out into thinking you can actually get “exercise” from playing video games.  Coming in as the “Battlefront box” was the Xbox One.  That’s basically the only game the children played on it (Star Wars Battlefront is a really fun game).  Heck, we had a PS4 at one point, where I myself mainly played Call of Duty.

We had quite a bit of fun playing some of those together.  One of the main issues that always seemed to come up though, was that at least a couple of us had to sit out and watch others play because most games on these systems realistically max out at 2 players.  Especially when you only have one TV on which to play them.  With a [family of 6](/about), this doesn’t scale very well.

### The Occasional Board Game Night
A couple times a year, we’d break out a board game or two from our (then) tiny collection and play them as a family.  These were always fun nights because we could all play together.  We were also able to talk and actually look at each other while we were playing.  Lots of laughs were usually heard on these nights as well.  At the time, our typical card/board games were ones like Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan or Apples to Apples.

### The Experiment
We decided to start making these board game nights a little more frequent.  Then they started happening all the time.  We even had some friends who invited us over for a “game night”.  I had never heard of such a thing!  After this experience, we were hooked!  “How can we do more of this?”, I thought.  Then a whole new world opened up to me that I had no idea existed.

I stumbled upon sites like [Board Game Geek](http://boardgamegeek.com) and the [Dice Tower](https://www.youtube.com/user/thedicetower) and quickly got myself a bootcamp education on the status of the board game world.  I’m [joeybeninghove](http://boardgamegeek.com/user/joeybeninghove) over on BGG if you care to connect with me over there.

We started making our wish list of games we wanted to buy and play.  There were so many cool looking ones from which to choose.  We quickly came to find out, some of these games were not cheap.  So we instituted a family budget allowance to purchase 1 new board game per month.  The first of the month turned into a mini-Christmas for all of us.

### The Storm
In the midst of all of this, we had a pretty nasty thunderstorm which ended up frying our TV.  (Don’t ask me why it wasn’t surge protected, it’s a long story).  Uh oh, that means no video games!  Naturally, we started playing board games even more, but we wanted more board games.  That’s when I had the epiphany (at least it was to me).

### The Big Sale
Sell all the video game things!  Now, I recognized this was a pretty drastic step, so I started planning it out in secret.  Finally, after some frustrating Craigslist and eBay experiences, we had sold all of our video game equipment.  We had money, a good amount of it!  We had just seeded our board game fund and were ready to go shopping.

### The Spending Spree
